## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Kele can exhaust the number of file descriptors available for Emacs to use.
- Fixed an issue where command families that require proxy servers, e.g. `kele-resource`, result in false-positive
  timeout errors when starting up the proxy server.

### Changed

- Discovery cache polling is now timer-based instead of "dynamic," i.e. in response to filesystem changes.

## 0.4.0

Lots of fun stuff in this release.

Most importantly, Kele 0.4.0 introduces `kele-list` (`s-k <resource type> l`)
and -- with it -- the ability to list all resources of a given type in tabulated
form. Before, you could only fetch single resources. Now, with `kele-list`, you
can create ad-hoc "overviews" of specific resource types within a given context
and namespace; hitting Enter on any entry in this list brings up the resource's
full manifest.

Kele 0.4.0 also introduces the `kele-proxy` command palette (`s-k p`) for
starting/stopping proxy servers for contexts. It also fleshes out the Kubeconfig
management command palette (`s-k c`).

For more details, see: [How-Tos > Usage].

### Added

- Added a `kele-proxy` command prefix for managing proxy servers
- Added a keybinding to `kele-context` to enable/disable the proxy server for
  the current context
- Added a keybinding to `kele-context` for deleting a context
- Added a keybinding to open `kele-kubeconfig-path` in a buffer
- Added a keybinding to `kele-resource` to support listing out all resources of
  a given type (`kele-list`)

### Fixed

- `kele-context` and `kele-resource` now wait on kubeconfig sync completion to
  finish if one is currently in progress
- Fixed a bug where force-enabling or force-disabling `kele-mode` (via either
  `(kele-mode 1)` or `(kele-mode -1)`) when `kele-mode` is already active or
  inactive (respectively) resulted in errors
- Fixed an issue where attempting to invoke `s-k <resource name> g` sometimes
  results in the following error: `transient-setup: Suffix
  transient:kele-resource::command is not defined or autoloaded as a command`

### Changed

- Renamed `kele-context` to `kele-config`
- Increased the default value of `kele-proxy-ttl` from `60` to `180`
- Binding for `kele-get` in `kele-get-mode` changed from `U` to `g`

## 0.3.0

This release focuses on providing Kele's command palette and user interface with
a scalable foundation for future growth. As Kele's spread of user-facing
commands grows, it becomes less and less reasonable to expect users to `M-x`
everything.

To that end, this release adds the following:

- A Kele command keymap that will allow keybinding-based access to all
  Kele-based functionality (see [How-Tos > Customization] and [How-Tos > Usage]
  for more details)
- A spread of three [Transient]-based "prefix" commands -- `kele-context`,
  `kele-resource`, and `kele-dispatch` -- for nested command discovery and
  ad-hoc configuration, e.g. overriding the context and namespace to use for
  resource fetching. Again, see [How-Tos > Usage] for more details.

I'm optimistic that these two additions make Kele's user interface much more
pleasant and nimble, while also giving it ample room to grow in complexity and
scope in the coming releases.

### Added

- `kele-get` resource name input now supports completion! :fire:
- `kele-get` buffers now have keybindings for quitting and killing the resource
  display buffer
- You can now press `U` in `kele-get` buffers to re-fetch and refresh the
  current resource
- `kele-get` buffers' front matter now outlines the available keybindings
- Added a `kele-dispatch` command for when you forget the specific keybinding of
  what you're trying to accomplish
- Added a `kele-context` command prefix for context-related actions
- Added a `kele-resources` command prefix for acting on specific resource kinds,
  e.g. `get`ting, with support for selecting the context, namespace, and the
  group-version to use (in cases of ambiguity)

### Changed

- Added dependency: [`s`](https://github.com/magnars/s.el)
- Removed dependency: [`requests`](https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request)
- Increased minimum required Emacs version to 28.1

## 0.2.1

This release focuses on refining the `kele-get` experience -- usability
improvements and general bugfixes.

### Added

- `kele-get` buffers now have a dedicated minor mode, `kele-get-mode`.
- `kele-get` buffers now print a header detailing, for the resource under
  display: the **context** it was fetched from; and the **time of retrieval**
- Added a custom variable `kele-filtered-fields` with which you can routinely
  filter out resource fields from display in `kele-get`

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `kele-get` results buffer incorrectly prints namespace
  for un-namespaced resources as `nil`
- Fixed an issue where `kele-get` refused to display the retrieved resource, if
  a buffer corresponding to that resource already exists

### Changed

- `kele-get` completion for the resource type now only returns resources that
  support the `get` verb

## 0.2.0

This release introduces `kele-get` -- `kubectl get`, the Emacs way
:rocket:. With `kele-get` you can interactively specify the kind and name of the
resource that you'd like to `get` and display its manifest in a separate
buffer. What's more, it supports custom resources right out the gate -- a
[long-standing functionality gap in `kubernetes-el`][k8s-el-69].

See [How-Tos > Usage > Working with
Resources](../how-tos/usage.md#working-with-resources) for details and a demo
GIF. It's very much an MVP so there are some rough edges. Please open an [issue]
for any peculiar behavior that you notice.

### Added

- Implemented `kele-get` for interactively getting and displaying a given
  resource
- Context annotations now display whether a proxy server is currently active for
  the given context
- Implemented interactive functions for per-context proxy server management:
  `kele-proxy-start`, `kele-proxy-stop`, and `kele-proxy-toggle`

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where disabling `kele-mode` resulted in an error reporting
  unbound slot `filewatch-id` on `kele--discovery-cache`
- Fixed an issue where cluster servers with ports,
  e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:51134`, were not recognized properly
- Fixed an issue where namespace completion candidates failed to populate on
  initial fetch of said namespaces from the Kubernetes API

### Changed

- Buffer for contexts' proxy processes are now hidden
- Default value for `kele-cache-dir` is now `~/.kube/cache`; before it was
  relative to the value of `kele-kubeconfig-path` (and unreliably so)

## 0.1.1

### Added

- Kubeconfig file watching is now asynchronous and therefore non-blocking!
- Kubeconfig file watching now prints a [progress report] denoting when changes
  were detected (and thus reading has begun asynchronously) and when reading has
  completed

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where proxies were being created for the current context,
  regardless of which context it was actually requested for
- Fixed an issue in `kele-namespace-switch-for-context` where the selection
  candidates were pulled for the **current** context rather than the argument
  context
- Fixed an issue where attempting to pull completion candidates via queries to
  the proxy API server resulted in an error, as well as multiple proxy server
  processes being inadvertently spun up for the same context
- Fixed an issue where custom kubeconfig path is not respected by `kubectl`
  invocations

### Changed

- Added dependency: [`plz`](https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el)
- Added dependency: [`async`](https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/)

## 0.1.0

Kele is born!

This initial release of Kele has a very simple goal: "[`kubectx` and
`kubens`][1], but make it Emacs." Its feature set is limited but lays the
foundation -- both in terms of implementation and "design philosophy" -- for
future enhancements.

### Added

- Added ability to switch and rename contexts, with completion and caching
- Added ability to switch namespaces for any given context
