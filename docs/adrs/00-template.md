# ADR 0000: [title]

<!-- These documents have names that are short noun phrases. For example, "ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10"
or "ADR 9: LDAP for Multitenant Integration" -->

## Status

<!-- A decision may be "proposed" if the project stakeholders haven't agreed with it yet, or "accepted" once it is
agreed. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference
to its replacement. -->

## Context

<!--
This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces
are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply
describing facts. -->

## Decision

<!-- This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice.
"We will ..." -->

## Consequences

<!-- This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here,
not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences,
but all of them affect the team and project in the future. -->
